# Object-Detection-with-YOLOV3
Deploying a computer vision model trained to detect common objects in pictures.

Welcome to the Object Detection Model Deployment Lab! In this lab, you will go through the process of deploying a pretrained YOLOv3 model for object detection. YOLOv3 is known for its speed and accuracy in object detection tasks.

## Lab Tasks

### 1. Inspect the Image Dataset
- Before deploying the model, it's essential to understand the image dataset you'll be working with. Inspect the dataset to get familiar with the images and labels used for object detection.

### 2. Explore the YOLOv3 Model
- Take a closer look at the YOLOv3 model itself. Understand its architecture and how it performs object detection. This step will help you understand how the model works before deploying it.

### 3. Deploy the Model Using FastAPI
- In this step, you'll deploy the YOLOv3 model using FastAPI, a high-performance web framework. FastAPI allows you to create an API endpoint for object detection, making it accessible for real-time inference.
